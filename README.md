# ClosestPair

Implement the algorithm for the closest pair of points (Section 33.4 in the textbook). Your algorithm should input the coordinates of the points in the point-set from a text file whose format matches the test files uploaded on D2L, and should output the coordinates of a closest pair in the point-set and the distance between the two points in a closest pair.
